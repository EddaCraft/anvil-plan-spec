# APS Rules for AI Agents

> This file guides AI agents working with APS specs in this repository.
> Keep it in `plans/` so agents discover it when exploring the planning directory.

## Core Principle

**Specs describe intent. Tasks authorise execution. Steps are checkpoints, not tutorials.**

## Hierarchy

| Layer | Purpose | You Write | You DON'T Write |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Index | Plan overview | Modules, milestones, risks | Implementation details |
| Leaf | Bounded module | Interfaces, tasks, boundaries | Code snippets |
| Task | Execution authority | Outcome, validation command | How to implement |
| Step | Checkpoint | Observable state | Implementation steps |

## Steps: The Lean Rule

Steps translate task intent into **observable checkpoints**. They are NOT implementation guides.

### Format

```markdown
### 1. [Action verb] [target]

- **Checkpoint:** [Observable state — max 12 words]
- **Validate:** `[command]` (optional)
```

### What Goes WHERE

| Write in Step | Write NOWHERE (emerges from patterns) |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| "Auth middleware exists" | Which library to use |
| "Tests pass" | Test implementation details |
| "Migration applied" | SQL schema definition |
| "Function handles errors" | Try/catch structure |

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER do this)

```markdown
# ❌ BAD: Implementation tutorial disguised as step
### 1. Create authentication middleware

- **Checkpoint:** Middleware created in src/middleware/auth.ts that:
  - Extracts JWT from Authorization header
  - Validates token using jsonwebtoken library  
  - Decodes payload and extracts user ID
  - Attaches user object to request context
  - Returns 401 if token invalid or expired
- **Validate:** `npm test -- auth.middleware.test.ts`
```

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD: Observable checkpoint only
### 1. Create authentication middleware

- **Checkpoint:** Auth middleware validates requests, attaches user to context
- **Validate:** `npm test -- auth.middleware.test.ts`
```

### Why Lean Steps?

1. **Implementation emerges** from existing patterns + agent judgment
2. **Specs don't rot** — checkpoints stay valid even when code changes
3. **Agents stay autonomous** — they figure out HOW, you verify WHAT
4. **Review stays fast** — humans scan checkpoints, not implementation plans

## Task Rules

Tasks are **execution authority** — permission to make changes.

### Required Fields

- **Intent:** One sentence — what outcome this achieves
- **Expected Outcome:** Testable/observable result
- **Validation:** Command to verify completion

### Optional Fields

- **Scope/Non-scope:** What will and won't change
- **Dependencies:** Other task IDs that must complete first
- **Confidence:** low/medium/high
- **Files:** Best-effort list (not exhaustive)

### Task Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| "Implement JWT auth using jsonwebtoken" | "Add token-based authentication" |
| "Create UserService class with methods..." | "User operations are encapsulated" |
| "Add try/catch blocks to all handlers" | "API errors return consistent format" |

## Creating APS Documents

### When Asked to Plan

1. Read existing `plans/index.aps.md` if present
2. Identify which template fits (index, leaf, simple)
3. Fill sections with **intent**, not implementation
4. Mark assumptions explicitly
5. Leave tasks empty until module is Ready

### When Asked to Execute

1. Find the task in the relevant `.aps.md` file
2. Check task has **Ready** status
3. Create steps file in `plans/execution/` if complex
4. Execute one step at a time, validate checkpoint
5. Mark task complete when validation passes

## Quick Reference

| If agent is... | Check for... |
|----------------|--------------|
| Writing steps | Max 12 words per checkpoint? No implementation detail? |
| Writing tasks | Outcome-focused? Has validation command? |
| Planning module | Boundaries clear? No premature tasks? |
| Executing | Task status is Ready? Prerequisites met? |
