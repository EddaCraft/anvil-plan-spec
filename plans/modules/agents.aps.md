## Purpose

Build distributable APS agents for each AI tool harness. The core agent
logic (planning lifecycle, repo hygiene) is the same across tools — what
changes is the packaging format. Claude Code, Copilot, and OpenCode use agent
markdown files with frontmatter. Codex uses a multi-agent system with TOML
configuration. Gemini is skill-only (no agent mechanism).

## Background

APS defines five conceptual roles (AGENTS.md): Planner, Implementer, Executor,
Reviewer, Librarian. Two exist as personal agents in code-env:

- `anvil-plan-spec.md` — Planner + Executor (planning, status, execution,
  wave coordination)
- `librarian.md` — Librarian (archiving, cross-refs, orphan detection)

These need to be:

1. Refined for distribution (strip personal assumptions, adapt to `.aps/`)
2. Ported to other tool harnesses (same capability, different packaging)

### Agent Mechanism Per Tool

| Tool | Agent Mechanism | Format |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | Frontmatter (name, description, model, tools) + system prompt |
| **Codex** | Multi-agent TOML + skills | `[agents.<name>]` in `.codex/config.toml` with `config_file` overlay; also `.agents/skills/` for passive guidance |
| **Copilot** | `.github/agents/<name>.md` | Frontmatter (name, description) + system prompt — very similar to Claude Code format |
| **Gemini** | `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | SKILL.md activated via `activate_skill` tool |
| **OpenCode** | `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` + skills | Frontmatter (description, mode, model, tools, permission) + system prompt; also skills at `.opencode/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` |

The agent *content* (system prompt, decision tree, APS knowledge) is largely
shared. What differs is frontmatter, file location, and tool-specific
affordances.

**Codex Multi-Agent Detail (Researched 2026-02-19)**

Codex has a richer agent mechanism beyond skills. The multi-agent system uses
TOML configuration in `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents.aps-planner]
model = "o4-mini"
config_file = ".codex/agents/aps-planner.toml"

[agents.aps-librarian]
model = "o4-mini"
config_file = ".codex/agents/aps-librarian.toml"
```

Each agent role gets a TOML overlay file with `developer_instructions`,
`sandbox_mode`, and other config. Agent threads run concurrently and are
managed via `/agent spawn`, `/agent route`, `/agent close` commands. Built-in
roles include `default`, `worker`, and `explorer`.

For APS, the Codex port should produce BOTH:

1. A skill (`.agents/skills/aps-planning/`) for passive guidance
2. Agent role configs (`.codex/config.toml` entries + `.codex/agents/*.toml`)
   for active dispatch

**Copilot Custom Agent Detail (Researched 2026-02-19)**

Copilot supports custom agents stored at `.github/agents/<name>.md` (repo
level) or in the `.github-private` repo (org level). Format is YAML
frontmatter (name, description, optional tools list) with a system prompt body
— structurally identical to Claude Code's agent files. This means the Claude
Code agent can be adapted with minimal changes: different file location,
frontmatter adjusted for Copilot's supported fields.

**OpenCode Agent Detail (Researched 2026-02-19)**

OpenCode has a rich agent system with two categories: primary agents (switched
via Tab) and subagents (invoked via `@mention` or Task tool). Agent files live
at `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
(global). Format is markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Agent purpose
mode: subagent          # primary | subagent | all
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514
steps: 50
tools:
  write: true
  bash: true
permission:
  edit: "ask"           # ask | allow | deny
---
System prompt here.
```

Key differences from Claude Code: `mode` field (primary vs subagent), `steps`
limit, granular `tools` and `permission` maps (per-tool allow/ask/deny), and
`model` uses `provider/model-id` format. The APS port should produce subagent
mode agents (users invoke them deliberately, not as the default primary agent).

## In Scope

- APS Planner agent for Claude Code (`.claude/agents/` format)
- APS Librarian agent for Claude Code
- Codex agent roles (`.codex/config.toml` + `.codex/agents/*.toml`)
- Copilot custom agents (`.github/agents/` format)
- OpenCode agents (`.opencode/agents/` format)
- Gemini skill equivalents (skills only — no agent mechanism)
- Shared core prompt that all harness variants derive from
- Documentation on when/how to use each agent per tool
- Testing in fresh projects

## Out of Scope

- Implementer/Reviewer agents (general-purpose, not APS-specific)
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- MCP server integration (separate TASKS module)
- Tool-specific UI integrations beyond skill/agent files

## Interfaces

**Depends on:**

- INSTALL (Ready) — agents are packaged and distributed by the installer

**Exposes:**

- `scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-planner.md` — Claude Code agent
- `scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-librarian.md` — Claude Code agent
- `scaffold/agents/codex/aps-planner.toml` — Codex agent role config
- `scaffold/agents/codex/aps-librarian.toml` — Codex agent role config
- `scaffold/agents/copilot/aps-planner.md` — Copilot custom agent
- `scaffold/agents/copilot/aps-librarian.md` — Copilot custom agent
- `scaffold/agents/opencode/aps-planner.md` — OpenCode agent
- `scaffold/agents/opencode/aps-librarian.md` — OpenCode agent
- `scaffold/agents/gemini/aps-planner/SKILL.md` — Gemini skill (no agent mechanism)
- `scaffold/agents/gemini/aps-librarian/SKILL.md` — Gemini skill

## Decisions

- **D-016:** Agent scope — Planner covers planning + execution + status +
  waves. Librarian covers archiving + cross-refs + orphans. No overlap.
  *decided: yes*
- **D-017:** Should agents reference `.aps/` paths or `plans/` paths?
  *decided: agents reference `plans/` (user content) and `.aps/scripts/`
  (tooling). They don't need to know about `.aps/config.yml`.*
- **D-018:** Shared core vs per-tool rewrite — *decided: write a shared core
  prompt, then wrap it in tool-specific frontmatter/packaging. Minimises
  drift between harness variants.*

## Work Items

### AGENT-001: Build APS Planner agent (Claude Code) — Complete 2026-02-21

- **Intent:** Create the primary Planner agent for Claude Code
- **Expected Outcome:** `scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-planner.md` with
  frontmatter (name, description, model: opus, tools) and system prompt
  covering: project init, index/module/work-item creation, status tracking,
  work item execution, wave-based parallel coordination. Derived from
  code-env's `anvil-plan-spec.md`, adapted for `.aps/` layout.
- **Validation:** Place agent in test project with `plans/`; dispatch via Task
  tool; agent reads plans, reports status, creates a module spec
- **Confidence:** high
- **Files:** scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-planner.md

### AGENT-002: Build APS Librarian agent (Claude Code) — Complete 2026-02-21

- **Intent:** Create the primary Librarian agent for Claude Code
- **Expected Outcome:** `scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-librarian.md` with
  frontmatter (name, description, model: sonnet, tools) and system prompt
  covering: archiving completed modules, orphan detection, cross-reference
  maintenance, stale doc flagging. Derived from code-env's `librarian.md`,
  adapted for `.aps/` layout.
- **Validation:** Place agent in test project with completed modules; dispatch
  via Task tool; agent identifies archivable modules and orphaned files
- **Confidence:** high
- **Files:** scaffold/agents/claude-code/aps-librarian.md

### AGENT-003: Port agents to Codex format

- **Intent:** Make APS agents available to Codex users via multi-agent roles
- **Expected Outcome:** Two deliverables per agent:
  1. Agent role TOML configs — `scaffold/agents/codex/aps-planner.toml` and
     `scaffold/agents/codex/aps-librarian.toml` containing
     `developer_instructions` (derived from shared core prompt),
     `sandbox_mode`, and model config. Installer merges `[agents.aps-planner]`
     and `[agents.aps-librarian]` entries into user's `.codex/config.toml`
     with `config_file` pointing to the TOML overlays.
  2. Codex config snippet — example `[agents.*]` blocks for documentation and
     installer to use when writing `.codex/config.toml`.
  Core planning/librarian logic identical to Claude versions, adapted for
  Codex's `developer_instructions` field and TOML format.
- **Validation:** Agent role appears in Codex; `/agent spawn aps-planner`
  starts agent thread; agent reads plans and reports status. Fallback: skill
  at `.agents/skills/aps-planning/` still works as passive guidance.
- **Confidence:** medium
- **Dependencies:** AGENT-001, AGENT-002

### AGENT-004: Port agents to Copilot, OpenCode, and Gemini formats

- **Intent:** Make APS agents available to Copilot, OpenCode, and Gemini users
  using each tool's native agent or skill format
- **Expected Outcome:** Three format variants:
  1. **Copilot** — `scaffold/agents/copilot/aps-planner.md` and
     `scaffold/agents/copilot/aps-librarian.md` with YAML frontmatter (name,
     description). Nearly identical to Claude Code format; installs to
     `.github/agents/`. Minimal adaptation needed.
  2. **OpenCode** — `scaffold/agents/opencode/aps-planner.md` and
     `scaffold/agents/opencode/aps-librarian.md` with frontmatter (description,
     mode: subagent, model, tools, permission). Installs to
     `.opencode/agents/`. Planner gets `mode: subagent` so users invoke it
     deliberately via `@aps-planner`.
  3. **Gemini** — `scaffold/agents/gemini/aps-planner/SKILL.md` and
     `scaffold/agents/gemini/aps-librarian/SKILL.md`. Skill format only
     (Gemini has no agent mechanism). Installs to `.gemini/skills/` or
     `.agents/skills/` with post-install `gemini skills link` instruction.
  Core logic identical to Claude versions across all three.
- **Validation:** Copilot agent discoverable at `.github/agents/`; OpenCode
  agent appears as subagent; Gemini skill links correctly
- **Confidence:** high
- **Dependencies:** AGENT-001, AGENT-002

### AGENT-005: Create agent documentation — In Progress

- **Intent:** Help users understand what each agent does and how to use it in
  their tool of choice
- **Expected Outcome:** Documentation covering: what each agent does, per-tool
  usage (dispatch command for Claude Code, skill invocation for Codex,
  activation for Gemini), when to use agent vs. passive skill, model cost
  implications
- **Validation:** Documentation exists with per-tool examples
- **Confidence:** high
- **Dependencies:** AGENT-001, AGENT-002, AGENT-003, AGENT-004

### AGENT-006: Test agents across harnesses

- **Intent:** Verify agents work correctly in each tool's environment
- **Expected Outcome:** Test plan covering: Claude Code Task dispatch, Codex
  `/agent spawn`, Copilot agent discovery, OpenCode `@mention` invocation,
  Gemini skill link. Each agent performs its core function (planner creates
  plan, librarian audits repo) without errors in the tool's native format.
- **Validation:** Tests pass on clean projects per tool
- **Confidence:** medium
- **Dependencies:** AGENT-001, AGENT-002, AGENT-003, AGENT-004, INSTALL-003

## Execution Strategy

### Wave 1: Claude Code agents (parallel, no dependencies)

- AGENT-001: APS Planner (Claude Code)
- AGENT-002: APS Librarian (Claude Code)

### Wave 2: Documentation (depends on Wave 1)

- AGENT-005: Agent documentation (partial — Claude Code section)

### Wave 3: Port to other harnesses (depends on Wave 1)

- AGENT-003: Codex multi-agent port (TOML config)
- AGENT-004: Copilot + OpenCode agents, Gemini skill

### Wave 4: Final docs + testing (depends on Wave 3)

- AGENT-005: Agent documentation (complete — all tools)
- AGENT-006: Cross-harness testing

## Notes

- The key architectural decision is **shared core, tool-specific wrapper**.
  The APS knowledge (hierarchy, templates, workflow, decision tree) lives
  in a shared core. Each harness variant wraps it in appropriate frontmatter
  and adjusts for tool-specific features.
- **Four tools now have real agent mechanisms** (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot,
  OpenCode). Only Gemini is skill-only. This is a significant finding — the
  original assumption was that only Claude Code had agents.
- **Adaptation effort varies by tool:**
  - Copilot: minimal — nearly identical to Claude Code (`.md` + frontmatter)
  - OpenCode: moderate — same `.md` format but richer frontmatter (mode,
    tools map, permission map, model as `provider/id`)
  - Codex: significant — entirely different format (TOML config, agent roles,
    `developer_instructions` field, concurrent thread model)
  - Gemini: minimal — skill only, no agent adaptation needed
- The Planner is the heavier agent (Opus for Claude Code, model varies per
  tool). The Librarian is lighter (Sonnet). Tools with model selection:
  Claude Code (model field), OpenCode (model field), Codex (model in TOML).
  Copilot and Gemini don't expose model choice in agent/skill config.
- Agents should NOT duplicate the SKILL.md content. The passive skill handles
  behavioral guidance (plan-before-code, update specs). The agents handle
  active dispatch (create a plan for me, audit the repo).
- OpenCode agents should use `mode: subagent` so they're invoked deliberately
  (via `@aps-planner`) rather than being the default primary agent.
