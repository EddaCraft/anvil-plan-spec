# Sync Task Status to APS

Use this prompt at session end to update APS files with task completion status.

---

## Prompt

```
Session complete. Here's what was accomplished:

Completed tasks:
- {TASK_ID}: {description}
- {TASK_ID}: {description}

Blocked tasks:
- {TASK_ID}: blocked because {reason}

New work discovered:
- {description of new work item}

Please update the APS files:

1. In the module file (plans/modules/{MODULE}.aps.md):
   - Mark completed work items with `Status: Complete (YYYY-MM-DD)`
   - Mark blocked items with `Status: Blocked: {reason}`
   - Add discovered work as new Draft work items

2. In the index (plans/index.aps.md):
   - Update "What's Next" section
   - Remove completed items
   - Add any new Ready items

3. Show me the git diff of changes for review.
```
