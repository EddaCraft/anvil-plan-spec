# Roadmap

The APS roadmap lives in [`plans/index.aps.md`](plans/index.aps.md) — we use APS
to plan APS.

## Quick Overview

| Horizon | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Current** | Usability — scaffold, templates, docs, validation |
| **Near Term** | Examples, prompt variants, compound engineering tooling |
| **Medium Term** | Issue tracker integration, solution search |
| **Long Term** | GitHub Action, VS Code extension, formal spec |

See [plans/index.aps.md](plans/index.aps.md) for the full breakdown with modules,
status, and work items.

## Non-Goals

These are explicitly out of scope:

- **Execution engines** — APS describes intent; it doesn't run code
- **Vendor plugins** — No Jira/Linear/Notion plugins (specs are portable markdown)
- **AI training** — Not a dataset for model fine-tuning
- **Hosted services** — No cloud component; everything runs locally
