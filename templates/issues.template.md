# Issues & Questions Tracker

> Development-time discoveries that emerge while building. Not a bug tracker replacement — a lightweight log for planning-level concerns that need visibility.

## When to Use This

Add entries here when you discover:

- **Issues** — Bugs, limitations, tech debt, edge cases noticed but not yet handled
- **Questions** — Unknowns that need answers, design decisions deferred, clarifications needed

**Don't add:** Routine bugs (use your bug tracker), implementation todos (use work items), solved problems (use solutions/).
